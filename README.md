# Coding Quiz Challenge

The task was to create a test using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This was built from scratch. Unique characteristics included in the assignment were requirements for a timer that would decrease in time for every wrong answer, a question being presented after one was answered until an end screen showed, and the ability to save high scores (time left).

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz<br />
WHEN I click the start button<br />
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br />
WHEN I answer a question<br />
THEN I am presented with another question<br />
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br />
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br />
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br />
THEN the game is over<br />
WHEN the game is over<br />
THEN I can save my initials and score<br />

## What, Why, How

### What:
The goal was to create a a quiz from scratch using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### Why:
I was motivated to apply the JAVASCRIPT concepts that I have learned thus far and grow in my understanding of the language. I learn best while doing and by trial and error. This allowed for both. 

### How:
Completing this task was difficult. I relied on all the resources available to me to complete it including, youtube, google, tutors, askBCS, and of course my course work. However, I still found it difficult to obtain all the required elements in my code. For example, while I do have a timer and the code does note where the time is at when the quiz is over and registers it as a score, I was only able to save the initials into localstorage and not the score. Further, my high scores button is not working due to not being able to pull high scores from the local storage into my site. Another shortcoming of my code is that when going through the test, no matter what answer, the code reads it as “wrong” and shows the “wrong” alert. Lastly, there is no time penalty when an answer is wrong. The timer is set to a minute to begin and continues to count down at a seconds pace instead of dropping the time for each wrong answer. It is important to note that I was able to get the score to drop by 10 for every wrong answer but this did not affect the timer, it would only show at the end towards the score. As a result the final score is always zero due to every answer being counted as wrong. <br>

I am submitting this assignment without all of the requirements due to wanting detailed feedback of how to improve and solve the issues outlined above. Class policy dictates that I can submit this up to 3 times and plan to do so once I receive feedback. Trial and error is one of the best forms of learning so I figured I could engage in that process now. In my professional experience rough drafts of proposals/projects are often submitted various times, with lots of feedback, before being approved. I am looking at this as my rough draft project and look forward to getting feedback that I can implement and improve my code upon.
